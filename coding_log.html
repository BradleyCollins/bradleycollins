        This is my daily coding log. Share in the pain and triumph as I dig deep
        and learn to code.

          Took the weekend off to spend time with the family. Back to coding on
          Monday though!<br />
          <br />
          Today I fixed up the desktop view for the projects grid. It took a bit
          to figure out what was going on with my images, but it ended up being
          a typo D:<br />
          <br />
          Thinking of trying out a React app or check out JAMstack next. I think
          my portfolio site looks OK for now, will add more cool stuff soon.

          Not much coding done today, but I did read a few good articles on
          <a href="https://dev.to/">Dev.to</a> as well as listened to the
          <a href="https://syntax.fm/">Syntax</a>
          podcats.<br />
          <br />
          I was really interested in the JAMstack article I read and started
          looking into it a bit more. It sounds really cool to work with, but I
          don't have any experience with API's right now. I'm trying to learn
          Javascript but I'm kinda stuck in a rut at the moment.<br />
          <br />
          One of these days, I'm going to get JS and I can't wait. laters

          I think I finalized my color scheme today. Luckily my wife was around
          to help as there were so many options! Aside from the colors, I fixed
          up the projects section a bit and added a second button so I can link
          out to a live link and my Github repository.<br />
          <br />
          One thing I was avoiding since I just started this site was...
          Javascript. Now that I am using an anchor tag in the navigation, the
          hamburger menu wasn't closing after clicking said link. It made menu
          seem broken so I set out for a fix.<br />
          <br />
          After some Googling, I came across a small script that does just that
          in Javascript! I edited it to work with my id's and now when you click
          "Projects" in the top nav while on mobile, it will close the hamburger
          menu automatically.<br />
          <br />

          It's late and I have work in the morning, but I want to keep going. I
          end up at work thinking about what I can add to my site and get pretty
          antsy to get home and start coding!

          Ended up redoing the project section grid on the Homepage. The more I
          started finalizing what I wanted to do with the layout, the more
          complicated the CSS became. I found a great codepen for a card demo
          and decided to re-purpose that for my projects section.<br />
          <br />
          I have the mobile view in a pretty good place, just need to work on
          the desktop view tomorrow.

          Today is the day. I spent probably 3 hours working on my site today.
          Which is probably the most I've ever spent. It feels good, damn good.
